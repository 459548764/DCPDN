We present a novel density-aware multi-stream densely connected convolutional neural
network-based algorithm, called DID-MDN, for joint rain density estimation and de-raining. The proposed method
enables the network itself to automatically determine the rain-density information and then efficiently remove the
corresponding rain-streaks guided by the estimated rain-density label. To better characterize rain-streaks with dif-
ferent scales and shapes, a multi-stream densely connected de-raining network is proposed which efficiently leverages
features from different scales. Furthermore, a new dataset containing images with rain-density labels is created and
used to train the proposed density-aware network.
